'       QBWrite is a simple text editing program that can create,  
'       print, save, and import files. QBW uses it's own format
'       for saving files, SO DO NOT OVERWRITE existing files with
'       the quick save feature. See WARNING! below. (L# 220 P# 13).
'    
'       To setup QBW to use all of it's sample and data files,
'       be sure to set up this program in it's own directory just
'       off the <C> drive. ( C:\UWLABS\... )

'
'       If this is not possible, open QBW in QBasic and <Search>
'       the program for all the "OPEN" statements. When you find one,
'       change any that DON'T contain variables to the appropriate
'       path. You may need to check ahead of these statements in the
'       program for path variables. These will listed as Path$,
'       NPath$, etc. It really shouldn't be too difficult. If you have
'       trouble, EMail me and I can send a corrected version, (one
'       with all paths set to your requests), when you register.
'
'
'
'       INTERESTING FEATURES:
'
'       QBW has a few interesting features. It is timed to update
'       the "StatusBar" every 15 seconds. This will keep the Time
'       current and the "TimeOut" on the screen saver updated.
'                                                       more...         (2)
'
'       Interesting Features (cont'd)
'
'       The StatusBar is also updated with each VALID keystroke
'       during editing. During program action, the TIMER is OFF
'       to prevent annoying cursor placement, or messing up the
'       work area. SO, obviously if you leave the program sit
'       while it is displaying a menu, the screen saver will not
'       function. (By the way, the SSaver is pretty cheesy).
'       The timeout on the SSaver can be changed by finding the
'       section of code labeled "SSaver:" and changing the variable.
'       There is an arrow pointing to the variable, so you can't miss
'       it. Change the number to the number of seconds you wish the
'       program to wait, (after a keystroke), before "sleeping".
'       5 minutes=300, 10 min=600, etc. Right now it is set to
'       5 minutes.

'       Interesting Features (cont'd)
'
'       QBWrite will allow you to change printer fonts on printers
'       that accept IBM "ESCAPE" codes. These are codes designed
'       to "program" IBM-type dot matrix printers. (Many other dot
'       matrix printers also accept these codes). NOTE: don't worry
'       about messing up the printer, these commands only remain in
'       effect while the printer has been left on. If perchance some-
'       thing obnoxious happens with your printer, just turn it off
'       and it should reset.
'     
'       A demonstration of use for these commands is in "Tutorial"
'       form using the sample files. Start with SAMP001.QBW and
'       follow the short instructions. Please note screen text
'       placement versus printer text placement, since the fonts
'       are double high or double wide or both.
'                                                       more...         (4)
'
'       Interesting Features (cont'd)
'
'       The display on QBWrite is 80 x 25 characters, with 21 lines
'       used for the editting area. (A "page" is 21 lines for the
'       editor). The print routines will select the number of line
'       feeds based on the last printer setup, so if you turn off
'       the printer, but don't restart the program, your line feeds
'       will not match. Using [F7] to clear the printer also resets the
'       PrintMode variable. You should hear 3 "BEEPS" when using this
'       feature. Other setups will send 1 "BEEP". (Always clear first)
'
'       Since QBW displays 21 lines of text at a time, in double high
'       print mode, the printed page will contain 1.5 screen pages, with
'       one blank line before and after each 31 lines. In single high
'       mode, Three screen pages are placed on the printed page.

'
'       Interesting Features (cont'd)
'
'       When printing in double wide mode, please remember only
'       40 characters can be printed per line on the printed page
'       so format your work to show on left half of the screen.
'       On some old files previously saved by QBW, and reopened,
'       The line "End" defaults to 80 characters. (Spaces were added
'       to the end of the line when the file was stored). Printing these
'       files unchanged will cause the program to pass a line feed
'       anyway, at the same time "wrapping" the text to fit the
'       printed page. In essence double spacing the print. This 
'       version of QBW has been corrected to prevent this, and in
'       doing so I have accidentally created and ANSI text editor.
'       If you have word processing programs that will read ANSI
'       files, then QBW files can be imported without a problem. You
'       can then even convert them to ASCII if you like.

'
'       QuickSave, Save AS:
'     
'       When you create a new file with QBW, the TITLE file
'       C:\UWLABS\UNTITLED.QBW is displayed. If the file has not
'       been previously saved by this editting session, when you
'       press [F5] for a "QuickSave", the "Save As..." PopUp will
'       show. At this time you may choose any valid path and file
'       name, the default path, or both the default path and default
'       file. The next time you press [F5], the QuickSave feature
'       will be active, YOU WILL NOT BE PROMPTED. the file is auto-
'       matically saved to the current path and file name. That is
'       why it is important to "Save As" first when you open an
'       existing file that is not a "*.QBW".

'
'       QuickSave, Save AS (cont'd)
'
'       An interesting footnote to having this default file avail-
'       able is that you can store recurrent documents in this file
'       so you may reopen them, modify them, and save them quickly.
'       This is handy for memos, form letters, notes, etc. You could
'       even use it to store messages to other users of your computer.
'       The default path not only is the default file to save, but also
'       the default file to open too. (I created this feature so my
'       children could save their latest literary creations, without
'       cluttering up the computer will tons of little text files).
'       You may find other uses to save editting steps too.
'
'       Kid note: Remind the little darlings to save things in the
'       defaults, if you don't want the clutter too.

'
'       Opening Files:
'
'       Like I said previously, QBW will open ASCII text files without
'       much incident, (Remember not to QuickSave), but file size is
'       restricted to the available stack space alotted by the clear
'       statement. If you open a file that is too large you will
'       undoubtedly get a "Out Of String Space" error. If you really
'       want to work on this file in QBW, first open it in an editor
'       or word processor that can hold the large file, then break it
'       down in to smaller files, then work on each individually. IT IS
'       POSSIBLE TO CREATE QBW FILES THAT QBW CAN'T REOPEN. (When the
'       file is reopened QBW will add a line or two at the end to format
'       the pages and allot array space). If you keep your documents
'       under 7 1/2 pages you should be Okay.

'
'       Opening Files (cont'd)
'
'       I tried to make QBW "smart" enough to trap improper file
'       paths and names, but you can't expect me to figure out ALL
'       the possible invalid inputs. Usually, the input line will
'       reset if the entered path/file is recognized as invalid.
'       If not, the error trapping routine will catch the error.
'       NOTE: If you get to an input line that you decide that you
'       don't want to use, (such as saving a file), and you are
'       already at the > input prompt. You can purposely enter an
'       invalid file name or path to cause an error and no save.
'       That way you can exit the input prompt, without writing over
'       a file or loosing the exsting one.

'
'       Your first task to attempt with QBW could be to print up
'       the following key assignments:
'              [Esc]           Exit Menu, Option, or Program

'
'       The rest of the keys you should be familiar with, BUT there        
'       are some minor differences.
'
'               [BackSpace]     Will only  backup to the top of the screen  
'               [Delete]        Will only "pull" text from the same line
'               [Home]          Only returns to column 1
'               [End]           Will goto column 80 on opened QBW files
'               [Enter]         Behaves only as a carriage return, and
'                               will not "bump" text. Also, press [Enter]
'                               to add a "page" to lengthen the doc.
'               [PgUp]&[PgDwn]  Only work when there's a page to go to.
'               [other]         Keystrokes not used will receive a tone
'
'       NOTE: if you don't want to retype all this information, I just
'       created a "FreeBee" file for a template. Open FREEBEE1.QBW and
'       print it in NLQ mode, you will then have a function key template.

'        WARNING!!!  WARNING!!!  WARNING!!!  WARNING!!!  WARNING!!!
'
'       This program trys to behave much like a text editor, but be
'       CAREFUL!!! The files it creates are not compatable with standard
'       ASCII text files. (Every 81st  character is a <CrRtn>).
'       IF YOU DECIDE TO OPEN AN ASCII TEXT FILE, PLEASE BE SURE NOT
'       TO SAVE IT UNDER ITS OWN NAME. (Once a file is opened, the [F5]
'       QuickSave feature is available). QBW won't destroy a text file,
'       but the extra spaces and carriage returns will make it useless to
'       to most other editors. The work envolved in repairing the file
'       will be most tedious. (Except some ANSI type editors).

'    Limitations:
'       QBWrite is a BASIC program, so its not going to be a full
'       functioning word processor. It's more like an editor.
'       I found QBW's limitations on my puny computer, (486sx25/8mg),
'       to be around 13,500 characters; that's about 170 lines or
'       7 and 1/2 screens. (@80 characters/line). That should be more
'       than enough space to create a memo or two.
'
'    Requirements:
'       Obviously, you need QBasic to run QBWrite, but you don't need
'       EGA/VGA video support, or necessarily a color monitor.
'       The text is displayed at 80x25, so most machines should be
'       able to run this program. If you use a reverse monochrome display
'       like some laptops do, remove or "rem" out the portion of code
'       in the InitScreen section that has the PALETTE statments.
'       It will then reverse black for white and dark gray for light.
'

'
'       Requirements cont'd:
'
'       If you like, QBW also comes in an EGA/VGA version. It still
'       uses screen 0, but works in 80x43 text mode with 64 colors.
'       (actually about 8 of the 64). I've seen it on a 17 monitor
'       and at that resolution it works good. (Not too small).
'
'       Although the comments in the code are sparse, I tried to use
'       variable and line label names that would indicate some kind of
'       purpose. Don't worry if looks like spaghetti, darn few basic
'       programs that I've viewed looked all that much better.
'          Go ahead, use it, parse it, dice it, slice it , whatever.
'       Just register it. Also let me know if it crashes and how; we
'       all must learn from our mistakes...
