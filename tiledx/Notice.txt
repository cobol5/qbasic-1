** IMPORTANT NOTICE.......

	Tiled X has only been released a couple days and already support
for Dimension SOFT is present. As we previously had stated we WILL 
bring out new releases of TILEDX as soon as new ideas come about on how
to improve the program. Sir Taylor of Sir Taylor's Heap of Junk asked 
for a palette change - delivered. Now the current in work additions is 
multiple size tiles and more keys such as page up and down, home, and 
end to make manuevering in the keyboard easier. Pull down menu's have
now become neccessary simply because there are to many things to do and
not enough icons to accomplish them all. It is quite possible I may 
just come out with a whole new layout and call it Tiled X2.

** HELP NEEDED......

	I've done quite a bit of programming within the lst year and 
have done a fairly decent job but I do need help. If anyone out there
can read this code and help me with a line, box, circle, and other 
functions it would be appreciated.

	That's all for now, hope all enjoy.
