     First of all thanks for trying out Dimension SOFT's first released 
product. A lot of research as far as what people want in a Tile Editor
have been implemented to quite an extent into this program. As time 
passes more updates will become available which expand upon this pro-
grams primary focus - user friendliness and versatility.
     Dimension SOFT is proud to bring new idees to programming. Aside
from making everything we program more like windows we have expanded
upon that idea immensely. One of which is small to the eye but is 
inherently new is the way our programs handle input. Most programmers
have a limit on how many characters they can input. We however have
done away with that in it's entirety. The more you type the more the 
filename will scroll to the left. Then there is Converge and the 
transparent color. I can't think of a single prorgammer that has done 
that as well. It's as original as original can get.
     TiledX, a fairly decent Tile Editor roughly 3 months worth of 
coding finally deserves to be released. Jay has spent numerous hours 
testing, retesting, and testing again to make sure that no fatal bugs 
occur or that a function properly runs. He has been an invaluable 
amount of help with this program and congrats go out to him. 
     With the option of using either a mouse or a keyboard TiledX
goes the distance with versatitly, pleasing all. There are only a few 
drawing modes but several ways to alter the graphics. Ranging from 
Paint background to Rotate Right and let's not forget Converge. With an
extensive help section that goes into grave detail what else could you
ask for - printing capabilities. For those of you who need the source 
code to display the tiles drawn, here you go.

DIM TILE(1600)
CLS
SCREEN 12

DEF SEG = VARSEG(TILE(0))
BLOAD FILENAME$, 0
DEF SEG

PUT (X,Y), TILE

     Last minute additions: If you leave the mouse on an icon it now 
will tell you what that icon is. Also if you right click on the icon
it will display the help for that icon. In the near future we hope to
continue on delivering excellence in Qbasic programs. Until next 
time - later....
