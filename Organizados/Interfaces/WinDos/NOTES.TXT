                              PROGRAMMERS

You will need BASIC PDS 7.1, QuickBASIC 4.5, BASM 6.5 and MASM 5.1 or newer
to compile all of WinDOS parts. aPACK is also used in the "make" scripts
mk*.bat to compress the executables.

Sorry that the code is rather messy and a bit difficult to read (with magic
numbers everywhere and poor modularity). This is due to the fact that I began
working on WinDOS way back at high school, when I didn't know much about
programming.

Please note that the file SEARCH.BAS contains a relatively fast and optimised
graphic object library, which enables the creation of automated buttons,
text boxes, etc. The module also contains the initial code for the file
searching utility with a fully working interface.

1. Search program.
2. Configurable internal archivers. Option for changing them.
3. Configurable compression tools with the ability to add new archivers.
3. Bottom bar click displays number of selected files.
4. Attachable "notes" to archives.
5. Other language support.
6. Store fonts in files.
7. Rename option if copying and file already exists.
8. Merge dirs.
9. "CopyTo" customisable menu.
10. Internal RAR.
11. OPEN/ApplyPal for Disktop.
12. Pie graph for directory sizes.
13. Reg. programs could be called with 1,2,3,4,5,6... keys.
