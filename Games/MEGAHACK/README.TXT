-= Author's comments =-
        This is some stupid thing which I started when I was first learning
how to program.  I just finished it off during some spare time and I really
couldn't be bothered to make it any better because it is too lame.
        This game (if you can call it a game) was written entirely in
QuickBasic.  If you would like the code please send a message to my e-mail
address down the bottom and I will consider sending it to you (depends how
I feel).
        If you are ready to and feel you have strong hacking ability, you
can try your hand at hacking the save game file.
