                             Stick Fighters Brawl
 Programed by Kevin Reems under Yummy Creations...Home of The Really Big Guy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I started this game, I wanted to put all other fighting games ever
written in any version of BASIC to shame.......I did it.

-Updates from the last version

 Memory problems with the Tile Screens should be fixed(I didn't have problems
in the first place so I can't test it). If you had this problem before 
please e-mail me and tell me if this worked.

 Bug in Stage 5 fixed (If you got so high that you were over the spikes, they
could still harm you).

New Stages.

New Moves.

The AI is a wee bit better.

You can now do a RoundHouse in the air.

 A few added keys, pressing 2 on the Number Pad also ducks now, you can use
Enter to select stuff in menus etc. 

Fixed some more problems that caused fighters to stretch.

I did another clean-up job on this text file.

-Version Number

You can find the version number in the Options Menu or within the .zip name

-System Requirements

Using the KeyBoard Only:
MS-DOS or Windows 95
486
QBASIC (Quick BASIC is HIGHLY recommended)
VGA Display

Stick Fighters Brawl is untested with OS/2
but should work with Power BASIC.

-A Note to AOL Users

The following statement was here in version 6.5, and is FALSE:

You probably will not be able to find Stick Fighters Brawl and many
other programs from Yummy Creations on AOL, this is because they no longer
release most programs that have multiple files. So if ya want something
from Yummy Creations you should contact us at lbt1st@cent.com
or get on The List (the form's at the end of this file).

Here are the facts from AOL:

The problem AOL has had are programs that require certain files to be placed
on certain drives or in certain directories.  However, this is only a
problem if the program does not contain a setup program to fully automate
the process for the user.
 Most BASIC uploaders do not realize that the majority of those who download
these files are not programmers -- in fact, many are novice computer users
altogether.  As a result, they are not comfortable (and sometimes not
capable of) manually installing programs into specific places in order for
the program to work.
 
So does this mean you can download Stick Fighters Brawl from AOL? 
Probably (I uploaded it) but even so, it can take over 2 weeks for it to be
released.  

-The Options Menu:

Player Energy is the starting Hit-Points of each fighter, use these to
handicap. 

Difficulty sets the starting Difficulty of the computer player.
Note: The computer doesn't get stronger or faster, but Smarter.

Stage This selects the Stage that you fight on.
                                                            (Speed)
1:  Your bobbing on a platform in an ocean.                  Slow
2:  An evil structure over a pit.                            Average
3:  A plat in the middle of nothing.                         Fast           
4:  An open chamber with tall pillars                        Slow
5:  Two spiked walls surround this arena.                    Average
6:  Evil is just under your feet here.                       Fast  
7:  Cruse space on top of a star fighter.                    Average/Fast  
8:  Deadly fans turn on at random times.                     Average
9:  A unit above bombs fighters with lightning.              Average/Fast
10: Fight on a sand bar, as Stage 1 floats by.               Average
11: This fan will render you nearly immobile.                Average
12: Fighters on Ice.                       	             Average/Fast
13: Fun with conveyer belts.                                 Average/Fast
14 & 15 Nothing                                              Very Fast


FX Mode- This controls some effects that can be used with Stage 3, if your not
fighting on Stage 3 then this is ignored.

Edit Fighter Options- Opens the Fighter Options Screen where you can change
the Colors and Detail levels of each fighter.

Joystick/Pad- These settings are for Joysticks and Game Pads, but most people
don't have a pad with 5 buttons, and BASIC only supports 4 anyway.
However you can move around with one, and attack with the keyboard at the
cost of game speed (why would you want to do this though?).

Sensitivity- Sets the Joystick sensitivity.

Joystick Correction- If you have problems with your joystick, try turning this
ON, and run in DOS (mode) if your in Windows.  

Special Moves- can be turned on and off.

Sound Wait- This sets how many times the program must loop until a sound can
be produced after another, if you find the game slowing down due to many
sounds or sounds are often cutting each other off then set this higher.

Gravity- You can make this higher or lower.

Detail- can be High or Low, if it's High you'll see nicer graphics.

Blood/Evil- set this to ON to get "bad" graphics (Blood, inverted crosses etc)
Blood can be set to 10 or 20 Gallons, only the second 10 Gallons will make
sound when hitting the ground.

Delay- sets the game's speed (the smaller the number the faster) but if you 
set it too low you may get screen flicker,
You'll have to experiment to see how fast you can get without flicker probs.
When changing this go up or down by 50s or 100s.
These Figures are for Quick BASIC, your video hardware will probably differ.
486 DX/2 50 set around 250
Pentium  60 set around 300
Pentium 133 set around 1000

Animation- Think of this as The Master Speed Dial! The larger the present
the more frames of animation will be rendered. So 100% renders everything
(slow) 10% renders very little (fast but chunky) so 40 and 60 present
are quite fast, yet not too chunky. Install defaults this at 60%

Done- Exits The Option Menu and saves changes.

Note: If you have Blood/Evil set to ON you'll see a useful drop of blood on
the right side of the screen, it shows you if Blood/Evil is ON, if Detail is
High or Low, and it's movement is effected by gravity.  

-Controls

KeyBoard
   --- --- ---                  --- --- ---  (Number Pad)
  | Q | W | E |                | 7 | 8 | 9 |
   --- --- ---                  --- --- ---
   | A | S |                   | 4 | 5 | 6 |
    --- ---                     --- --- ---

4 and 6 walks Left and Right.
8 jumps up, 7 and 9 Jump Forward and Away.
5 Duck (2 also Ducks).
You can also use the cursor keys but the 7 and 9 keys on the pad are nice,
also, you MUST have NUMlock ON for the number pad to work!

Q Jab.
W Strong Punch.
W While Ducking is an Upper-Cut 
A Short Kick.
S Roundhouse (If you have good footing otherwise it's a Short Kick).
E Charges for a Special Move.
If you hold down A for two seconds you'll do a Lighting Kick.
Pressing E (Don't hold it down) will Charge a meter at the top of the screen,
the longer you wait the more powerful. After you charge-up press Q, W or S
to throw a Fire Ball, Rising Dragon or charge your Jump Bar.

Capcom Pad (PC Fighter 6)

        -
Same as above,
X=Q
Y=W
Z=E
A=A
B=S
C=(not used)

-Charging your Jump

 To charge your jump, just charge using E as normal, then press
S to charge your Jump Bar, the next time you jump (both feet must be on the 
ground) you'll go much higher, only half of the bar will be used.
The main use of this is to use with your Rising Dragon, it will use all
of both charge-bars but causes more damage.

-The Warning Light

 This little light comes in handy on stages where something turns on and off
and such. Because the camera tends to go all over the place to keep the
fighters on-screen, you can't always see if that Fan just behind you is ready
to cut you to little bits, so on Stages with stuff like Fans, the light will
turn red when there is danger.

-How to Pop The Cork    

 Everyone keeps asking me how you decapitate your opponent, so here's the
how'to. First of all Blood/Evil must be on or decaps are disabled. 
Win one round, then drain their Energy to almost nothing, then you you must
hit 'em with ether a Strong Punch (to the head) or a Rising Dragon.
If all was done right that bugger will pop right off (making a big mess),
and if your really lucky (added in V4.5) they won't fall down, if this
happends, the fighter will remain active for a random amount of time, running
around like a chicken with it's head cut off (making a bigger mess)!
In the event that a headless fighter kills you, you will still be credited
for the win.

-Stuff to Remember

When doing a Lighting Kick you can slide (walk forward a LITTLE then hold A).

Try Jumping, then immediately Press W for a Rising RoundHouse. 

A Fire Ball can be weakened by another Fire Ball.

If you only have one foot on the ground you can still move, but your
limmited, like if you try to jump you will only hop.

You can jump vary far, and again two feet are better then one. 

Upper-Cuts don't hurt as much as Rising Dragons.

If you beat the computer the difficulty increases by one.

Avoid sharp objects.

Don't forget about your fists, they're very powerful once in range.

If the game's too easy handicap the computer player.

If you think throwing fire at somebody is cheap, turn Off Special Moves.

Have Fun, that's what it's all about!
