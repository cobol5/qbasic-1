-------------Installing Stick Fighters Brawl by Yummy Creations--------------

 First, you must make a directory to Install to (The Install program WILL NOT
make the directory to install to).

Make sure the Path in your Autoexec.bat file points to your QB directory.

If you have an older version of Stick fighters Brawl you need not delete it,
just install over it.

Run the Install.bat file. It will launch the Install Program
for Stick Fighters Brawl.
 Note: If you don't have Quick BASIC, but you have QBASIC run InstallQ.bat
instead.
 You will be asked for the drive letter and path to install to,
then you will be asked if it's OK to create SFBPath.dat
If you answer NO, Install will end and no files will be copied
or changed. The game needs this file to run so you must answer
YES to install. The reason you're asked is because the file
is placed in C:\Windows\System, this is a very important
directory (folder in Win 95) for Windows and if a file is changed
or deleted Windows may not run properly, also Windows 95 is very
picky about this folder and may give error messages at start-up
if changed. So Yummy Creations will always tell you before
any changes are made to such directories. We will also use
uncommon filenames to avoid problems. Odds are you don't have
a file of the above name so you shouldn't have problems, but
we at Yummy Creations have had such problems when installing
other people's games under Windows 95. So we don't want to
follow in their foot-steps. With all that said and done the game
should be installed on your PC.

There is no UnInstall for Stick Fighters Brawl so if for some
reason you wish to get rid of it, just delete the directory
you Installed it to and the file C:\Windows\System\SFBPath.dat

Q & A

Q The game keeps locking up, what should I do ?
A If you see some kind of momory error skip this Answer. Try Re-Installing
  without sound. If this doesn't help e-mail me at lbt1st@cent.com

Q I'm getting an Out of Memory Error before the game even starts.
A This has been a problem for many users, Try by-passing the Title screens
  by pressing a key before the words Stick Fighters Brawl complete lining up.

Q I don't even see any words before I get Out of Memory, Help!
A You may not even have enough memory to run QB. If your in Windows, try
  running in DOS and/or free up some conventinal memory by editing your
  Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files (see your DOS guide). You should also
  run MemMaker after you do so (type memmaker at the DOS prompt).

Q The game runs fine for a few a while but then it drops out for no reason.
A You may need more conventional memory (see above Q & A).

Q My computer keeps beeping at me, what can I do ?
A Stop holding down that button! Remember, this game's written in BASIC.
  If you press two keys, the first one must register before the second one
  is checked, so if you hold down a key, and it starts going into turbo
  the program must loop a bunch of times to regester all that. What this
  all means is you can hold a key down, but don't hold it forever. And if
  the game is running slow it'll be worse. 
   You may also want to try dropping the key speed rates if your using
  Windows (in control panel).

Q Could you tell me how you made a part of the program ?
A Yep, Yummy Creations now makes Demos by request! No charge, just ask us
  how something was done and (if possable) we'll get a Demo out for you and
  anyone else who wants it.
  
Q How did you get Sound Blaster Sound ?
A The Original code was given by Bostrom Design, were still learning from it.

Q How did you make the title screens ?
A Using QB-Paint from The S.H.Softworx you can make 256 color images, if you
  program in Q or Quick (and probably Power) BASIC, you should download it. 

Q My Config.dat file got messed-up, can I get a new one ?
A When you Installed the game, it made a copy of the Install program
  in the same directory. Run that copy of Install.BAT (or InstallQ.bat) to
  respawn a new config.dat
  
Q The Game runs too slow, How can I speed things up ?
A Set Graphic Detail to Low, Set Blood/Evil to OFF or 10 Gallons, Use Fast
  Stages, set the Fighter Details to Low, rise Sound Wait, drop Animation.

Q I don't like the use of Blood or Evil in games, I think the whole idea is
  really sick!
A You have two options, a)Turn Blood/Evil to OFF b)Play a different game.

Q I keep getting an error saying file not found... what can I do ?
A Reinstall the game. If you just copied the files then it won't work.
  The How'to is at the top of this file.

Q Sometimes when I try to punch, nothing happends, why?
A There is a short waiting period you must wait before punching, this keeps
  people from "Turbo Punching". The stronger the punch the longer the wait.

Q Sometimes a fighter stretches all over the place, whats wrong ?
A It's nothing you did wrong. Stick Fighters Brawl does not use sprites for
  animation, instead it uses a list of Commands/Positions. This allows for
  awesome animation. For example, if a fighter is just standing there, then
  is kicked in the head, The SFB Animation Engine tells that fighter to try
  to get into a falling position and how to do so. But every now and then a
  command won't "clean up" after itself before the next position. When this
  happends you'll often see an arm or something start getting away! As the
  programmer it's been my job to make sure that the commands "clean up" after
  themselves, so as new versions come out this should be less a problem.

Q The whole screen is flashing! what can I do?
A The game has a great graphics engine thar completely eliminates draw-in,
  (for info on this or anything else used in the game e-mail us)
  problem is some computer's screens flash, this could be due to speed
  differences in video hardware. The only way I know of to stop this is to
  slow down the game. You can do this by setting the Game Delay in Options.
  Of course the whole game must slow down because of this, so you must zero
  in on the best setting.

Q What are the sticks in the ground on some of the Stages?
A No they can't hurt you or trip you or anything. They're in some of the
  Stages with little background graphics, so when the fighters are both 
  zipping along and the camera is panning and zooming you can still see
  stuff going by, without these you can get confused or even sick.

Q When I first start the game the volume is low then slowly rises, why?
A I'm gonna tell the truth, I have know idea as to why this happends.
  By the time you start a fight it should be all the way up though.
