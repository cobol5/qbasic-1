1}-----------Install.bas for RoadHog 2 Ver 2.Q----------

 If you downloaded RoadHog 2 from America OnLine using
version 2.5, DO NOT MOVE THE FILES to another directory
unless using INSTALL did NOT work! 

 This Install Program will NOT work with a 
previous version of RoadHog 2.
 Install.bas will run a few tests to insure the game
will run on your system, then you will be asked if you
wish to install. You can us this to test your system
and quit before installing.

Install can also UNinstall!
And can make  copys of RoadHog 2 to a Disk.

2}----------------About RoadHog 2 ver 2.Q---------------

 RoadHog 2 Programed by Kevin Reems is somewhat a 
shooter/Driving Game with a verity of enemies and bosses
 This Game has no end . . .
RoadHog 2 kinda has about 30 levels but there is no real
ending. Every ten levels or so you'll fight a new boss,
so when you stop seeing the bosses it's kinda over.
 RoadHog 2 also has many weapons and upgrades for your
car that will help you,some are required to destroy some
bosses. The higher the level you are on the more things
will be available.            
  
3}----------------------Updates-------------------------  

 Version 2.Q is, for the most part the same as 2.0
but 2.Q is for Quick-BASIC, NOT Q-BASIC.
 You may get it to run in Q-BASIC, but it will be slow.
If you don't have Quick-BASIC, get RoadHog 2 version 2.0

4}-----------------How To use DEFAULTS------------------

 For a while now AOL has been telling users that 
RoadHog 2 REQUIRES a Joystick, This is NOT true for
versions 1.1+
Apparently they didn't read the documentation before the
program, so I'm telling them and more importantly you to
read it!
It also includes TroubleShooting to help you with it!
 No computer is the same, so with the DEFAULTS section
you should be able to get RoadHog 2 running without
being a programmer.
 It will allow you to change detail settings, weapon
configurations at startup, and let keyboard users play
too! 
 I know this File doesn't directly tell you how to use
DEFAULTS, but the documentation before the main program
(Hog2.rh2) will help when using it.
