Space Block (C)Philip Lutas 1999
================================

This is my third game I thought of after trying to make a Pong
clone. I added two player support using a joystick or else the player
just controls both of the bats. I have also included a VERY basic level
editor for which to make your own tilesets.
Don't forget to edit the directory to where you have put spaceblock!

Modes:
Filename > Used to load any level that you have made
ENTER    > Used for a random level. Press enter again for default value
g        > Competition I have included. The object of the game is to
           get the highest score you can over 5 levels. The levels
           advance if you lose three lives or if you complete the level
           You compete for the highest score.

Files:
SPCBLOCK.BAS > The game!
EDITOR.BAS   > The tile editor
.BLK files   > These are the levels
SPCBLOCK.HI  > The high score file for the competition
