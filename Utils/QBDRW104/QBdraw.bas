' QB draw source code loader | (C) Lior Zur, 1997

' Contact: zur@inter.net.il
'*********************************************
' The code above is required !
' in order to load picture, you
' use two sub programs. Call the first,
' to get all the info about the picture
' such as version, array size and more.
'**** be aware of: ****
' - Put the file name when
'   calling this function WITHOUT .PIC !!
' - This function leaves the file open !!
' - This function also closes any opened file !!
'**********************
' Then, you have to declare array in the
' size of DimSize - the integer that the
' first function brought as the array size data.
' Then, call the secend sub (OpenPic2) to complete
' loading the picture into the array you declared.
' The array must be integer !
'******************************
' the first function gives you error codes, if something's wrong. Here they
' are:
'******************************
'-1 there is no such file !
'-2 not QB draw file !
'-3 file made by later version
' 0 everything is fine !
'******************************
'also, there is the sub PalLoad to load palettes.
