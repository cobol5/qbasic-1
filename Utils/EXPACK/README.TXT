ExPack v1.0 Final - Readme
-==================================================================
Use EXPC for packing (compressing) a file, a file with .EXC extension
will be created.
Use EXPU for unpacking (decompressing) that file to the original file.

For more help, start EXPC.EXE with the /B option ("EXPC /B")

-> Hint : Don't try to compress files that already are smaller than
15 KB...it will only become bigger!
