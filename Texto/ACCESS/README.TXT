Welcome to the Alpha version of Access!

    This was made by Specialist Odis M. Clemons from the US Army (B.co, 436th
trans btn.)  Accss is my operating system.  I designed it from the Windoze
engine.  There are a few bugs in it.  This is just an alpha version.  Please
do not release any programs for it until I make the actual release.  This way
I can add features and delete some.  Email me at cybershinakuma1@yahoo.com as
soon as you get this to tell me the bugs and your opinion on this OS.

P.S.
When you first run this OS, it won't run.  You must read the credits at the
end to see how to run it.
