                            Qbasic Image Library

        You have just seen some of the abilities of the Qbasic Image Library.
The Qbasic Image Library is a very powerful tool that can do many things. Here
is a more extensive list of it's abilities.

BMP Image Format: There are several things you can do with bitmaps.
The BMP loader can load any size of BMP file though only the first 320x200
pixels will appear on screen.  The BMP loader currently loads only 8 bit, 256
color BMPs with possible support for 16 color BMPs in the future.  The BMP
writes at any size but anything after 320x200 pixels will be black.  The BMP
writer works off already created BMPs and only rewrites pixel and palette 
information.  The writer does not write any size information.  You must have
BMP of the desired size to write to.

BMP Palettes:  You can load and write the palette information of any 256 color
BMP file.  The file can be made the active screen palette or can be saved to
a PAL format or a BPL format.  Each format has different uses.  The PAL format
can be written into a QSI file and the BPL format can be written into a BMP
file.  The PAL file can be loaded directly into Qbasic.

Palettes:  The PAL file format can be loaded as the active palette in several
different ways.  You can load the palette as is with no changes, change the
RGB values while loading, or use different loading filters such as gray 
scaling, red scaling, etc.  There is also a palette editor that can load, 
save, edit, and create new palettes with an easy to use mouse interface. Run
PALETTE.BAS to see the demo.  The demo does not allow you to save or load
palette files.

QSI Files:  The QSI file format is an image format currently supported only
by the Qbasic Image Library.  The QSI format is very simple, fast, and 
versatile.  QSI files can be written with on screen images or converted 
directly from BMP format.  The palettes of the QSI image format come from
PAL files.  QSI image files can be loaded using several different loaders. 
Each loader has it's own specific abilities, command lines, and speeds.  The
simpler the loader the faster.  Here is a list from fastest to slowest.  The
speed is how long it takes to load one 320x200 image on a Pentuim computer.
The speed may vary.

                   move the RGB intensities up or down.  Gives the option of
                   not changing color 0.  Allows the use of a load map.
        Speed: 11.48047

        Name: LOADQSIMP
        Abilities:  Loads a QSI image to any place on screen.  Allows the use
                    of a load map.
        Speed: 15.38281

        Name: LOADQSIA
        Abilities: Loads a QSI image to any place on screen.  Allows loading
                   in different sizes(E.G. 1/2 or 2x)
        Speed: 17.02734

        Name: LOADQSIAB
        Abilities: Loads a QSI image to any place on screen.  Loads only the
                   specified part of the image.  Allows loading in different
                   sizes.  Allows for changing RGB intensities.  Gives the
                   option of not changing color 0.
        Speed: 38.22656

ILI image format:  The ILI image format is an incredibly simple image format.
                   The ILI image format uses Qbasic GET and PUT commands to
                   save information to disk.  ILI images do not load pixel by
                   pixel like most image formats, but all at once and very 
                   quickly.  On a Pentium computer an ILI image will load in
                   less than a second.  A 300 frame animation at a size of
                   200x150 can run at about 30 frames per second while a 100
                   frame 50x50 animation will run at over 70fps(on a Pentium)
                   making the ILI format great for animation.  The only
                   restriction of an ILI image is that the image must be held
                   in an array which cannot hold full screen images.  The ILI
                   format does not contain palette information.  Programs have
                   been designed to load 320x200 and 640x480 ILI images,
                   however.

How to order:  The full version of the Qbasic Image Library is $10.00 + $3.00
               Shipping.  I chose to keep the program as inexpensive as
               possible.  Here is what the registered version includes.
                
               _ All subs for loading, saving, and editing all QIL supported
                 formats.

               _ Any new programs added to newer versions.

               _ Explanations of loading and saving QIL supported formats.

               _ The complete palette program.

               _ A file explaining the usage of all the programs and abilities
                 of the QIL.

               _ A file explaining how to use the popular and widely supported
                 BMP image format.

Please excuse any typos.

Upcoming:
        In the near future new formats, such as PCX and GIF formats, may be
supported.  Horizon Software may soon be releasing a game kit, a collection of
QBasic game engines and tools.  On AOL search under keyword Horizon Software
in the software search to find other Horizon Software programs.  Also look
for animations uploaded in ILI format, also under the Horizon Software
keyword.
