  This program is Freeware. You may use or distribute it any way you like as 
 long as no fee is charged. I wrote this program on a pretty old computer
 so the graphic may run to fast on fast machines. If I write another verson
 I will program a speed setting into it. 
     
  The code is not as neat as it should be, but when I wrote this I tried to
 use as many different QBasic commands and functions as  I could. It 
 demonstrates the use of Time Conversion, Subs, Switches, Graphics, Play,
 Sound, Timer and other stuff. Also it works well. (Wakes me up every morning)

                               

     This program will not harm your computer in any way but if you think it has I
 except no responsibilty.            

   Thanks to Dave Shea for his creation of Elvis.



  Well, Hope you enjoy it.
